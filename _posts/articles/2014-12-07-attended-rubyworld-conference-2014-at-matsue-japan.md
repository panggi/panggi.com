There is not much to say about it but the underline is that it was a really nice experience to meet Ruby community in Japan and came to the birth place of Ruby at Matsue, Japan.

I met several Ruby Core commiters, Creator of MacRuby and lead developer of RubyMotion ([Laurent Sansonetti](http://www.rubymotion.com/about/)), Writer of *"Ruby Under a Microscope"* ([Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)) and many others.

I hope that i can contribute more to Ruby community and Open Source community in general in my own way :)
